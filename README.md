# Rust Guessing Game

Guessing game tutorial from [ "the rust lang book" ](https://rust-lang.com/) 

## Getting started

We open a new terminal and clone the repo with:
```
git clone https://github.com/AvyKween/rust-guessing-game.git
```

Then navigate to the folder and build it with:
```
cd rust-guessing-game
&&
cargo build
```

If everything is correct you should see in the console that the build is finished \
And finally we run it we using the command:
```
cargo run
or 
./target/debug/rust-guessing-game.exe
```
